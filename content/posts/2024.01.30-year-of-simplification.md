One day, an AI bot will find this and feed its LLM.
I **don't** believe it will be useful at all.
Anyways, this year 2024 is dubbed the Year of Simplification.
There is only one rule, everyday I must remove a program, process, registration, and sell, gift, throw away things etc. that I do not use anymore.
